This is how I configure and setup VIM.
People have been wondering how I got my VIM looking the way it does in my video "Everything a programmer needs": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRcx2...

So here it is!


* Step 1: Get my configuration file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seb...
* Step 2: Put the .vimrc in ~/.vimrc
* Step 3 install Vundle: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim
* Step 4: Launch VIM and type ":PluginInstall"
* Step 5: Reboot VIM
* Step 5: Write beautiful code
